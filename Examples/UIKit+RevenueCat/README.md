# UIKit+RevenueCat Example App

This app demonstrates how to use SuperwallKit with RevenueCat and UIKit. We've written a mini tutorial below to help you understand what's going on in the app.

Usually, to integrate SuperwallKit into your app, you first need to have configured a paywall using the [Superwall Dashboard](https://superwall.com/dashboard). However, with this example app, we have already done that for you and provided a sample API key to get you up and running. When you integrate the SDK into your own app, you'll need to use your own API key for your own Superwall account. To do that, [sign up for a free account on Superwall](https://superwall.com/sign-up).

## Requirements

This example app uses:

- UIKit
- RevenueCat 4.17.11
- Xcode 14
- iOS 16
- Swift 5.5

## Getting Started

Clone or download SuperwallKit from the [project home page](https://github.com/superwall/Superwall-iOS). Then, open **Superwall-UIKit+RevenueCat.xcodeproj** in Xcode and take a look at the code inside the [Superwall-UIKit+RevenueCat](Superwall-UIKit+RevenueCat) folder.

You'll see a file called [RCPurchaseController.swift](Superwall-UIKit+RevenueCat/RCPurchaseController.swift) which handles the subscription-related logic of both Superwall and RevenueCat.

[Superwall_UIKit+RevenueCat-Products.storekit](Superwall-UIKit+RevenueCat/Superwall_UIKit+RevenueCat-Products.storekit) is a StoreKit configuration file that is used to mimic the setup of real products on App Store Connect. This is so you can make test purchases within the sample app without having to set up App Store Connect. In a production app, you will need real products configured in App Store Connect but you can also use a StoreKit configuration file for testing purposes if you wish.

You'll see [Main.storyboard](Superwall-UIKit+RevenueCat/Base.lproj/Main.storyboard) specifies the the layout of the app and other swift files handle the presentation of Paywalls.

Build and run the app and you'll see the welcome screen:

</p>

SuperwallKit and RevenueCat are both [configured](Superwall-UIKit+RevenueCat/AppDelegate.swift#L16) on app launch. An instance of the [RCPurchaseController.swift](Superwall-UIKit+RevenueCat/RCPurchaseController.swift) is passed to Superwall, which is used to handle all subscription-related logic.

## Logging In

On the welcome screen, enter your name in the **text field**. This saves to the Superwall user attributes using [Superwall.shared.setUserAttributes(_:)](Superwall-UIKit+RevenueCat/PaywallManager.swift#L84). You don't need to set user attributes, but it can be useful if you want to create a rule to present a paywall based on a specific attribute you've set. You can also recall user attributes on your paywall to personalise the messaging.

Tap **Log In**. This identifies the user with Superwall and RevenueCat using the username that you inputted, retrieving any paywalls that have previously been assigned to you and retrieving the user's entitlements from RevenueCat. Every time the entitlements are updated, `Superwall.shared.entitlements` is set.

You'll see an overview screen:

## Presenting a Paywall

At the heart of Superwall's SDK lies [Superwall.shared.register(event:params:handler:feature:)](Superwall-UIKit+RevenueCat/HomeViewController.swift#L62).

This allows you to register an event to access a feature that may or may not be paywalled later in time. It also allows you to choose whether the user can access the feature even if they don't make a purchase. You can read more about this [in our docs](https://docs.superwall.com/docs).

On the [Superwall Dashboard](https://superwall.com/dashboard) you add this event to a Campaign and attach some presentation rules. For this app, we've already done this for you.

When an event is registered, SuperwallKit evaluates the rules associated with it to determine whether or not to show a paywall.

By calling [Superwall.shared.register(event:params:handler:feature:)](Superwall-UIKit+RevenueCat/HomeViewController.swift#L62), you present a paywall in response to the event `campaign_trigger`.

On screen you'll see some explanatory text and a button to launch a feature that is behind a paywall:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3296904/161961942-2b7ccf40-83d1-47c5-8f49-6fb409b17491.png" alt="Presenting a paywall" width="220px" />
</p>

Tap the **Launch Feature** button and you'll see the paywall. If the event is disabled on the dashboard, the paywall wouldn't show and the feature would fire immediately. In this case, the feature is just an alert.

## Purchasing a subscription

Tap the **Continue** button in the paywall and "purchase" a subscription. When the paywall dismisses, the "feature" is launched and you'll see an alert. Try launching the feature again. You'll notice that the feature is fired immediately and no longer shows the paywall. Paywalls are only presented to users who haven't got an active subscription. To cancel the active subscription for an app that's using a StoreKit configuration file for testing, delete and reinstall the app.
